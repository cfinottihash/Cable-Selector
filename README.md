# Medium Voltage Cable Accessory Selector

A smart, data-driven tool to help technical and commercial teams select the correct medium-voltage cable accessories based on cable characteristics.

##  Project Overview

This project simplifies the selection of medium-voltage cable terminations and connectors by using structured logic based on:

- Cable insulation outer diameter (O.D.)
- Conductor cross-sectional area (bitola)
- Presence or absence of a test point
- Cable manufacturer (optional, for estimating O.D. if unknown)

The goal is to support internal technical sales and engineering workflows, and eventually offer a web-based interface to assist external users.

# Why This Project

Selecting the right accessory for a specific cable type can be error-prone due to overlapping specs, multiple part numbers, and lack of cable O.D. information. This tool:

- Converts product catalogs into structured, searchable data
- Links cable specs to compatible accessories
- Builds a logic-based interface for accurate and fast selection
